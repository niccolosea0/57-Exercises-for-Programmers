Exercise 32: Guess the Number Game

    Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of
    difficulty. The first level of difficulty would be a number
    between 1 and 10. The second difficulty set would be
    between 1 and 100. The third difficulty set would be between
    1 and 1000.
    
    Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game. The
    computer picks a random number in that range and prompts
    the player to guess that number. Each time the player
    guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to
    whether the number is too high or too low. The computer
    should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the
    player guesses the correct number, the computer should
    present the number of guesses and ask if the player would
    like to play again.
    
    Example Output
        Let's play Guess the Number.
        Pick a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 1
        I have my number. What's your guess? 1
        Too low. Guess again: 5
        Too high. Guess again: 2
        You got it in 3 guesses!
        Play again? n
        Goodbye!
    
    Constraints
        • Don’t allow any non-numeric data entry.
        • During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong
        guesses.
    
    Challenges
        • Map the number of guesses taken to comments:
            – 1 guess: “You’re a mind reader!”
            – 2–4 guesses: “Most impressive.”
            – 3–6 guesses: “You can do better than that.”
            – 7 or more guesses: “Better luck next time.”
        • Keep track of previous guesses and issue an alert that
        the user has already guessed that number. Count this
        as a wrong guess.
        • Implement this as a graphical game with a grid of
        numbers. When a number is clicked or tapped, remove
        the number from the screen.
