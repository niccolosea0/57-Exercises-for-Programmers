Exercise 28: Adding Numbers

In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input
by writing the input statements multiple times. But it’s more
efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.

Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and
computes the total of the numbers.

Example Output
    Enter a number: 1
    Enter a number: 2
    Enter a number: 3
    Enter a number: 4
    Enter a number: 5
    The total is 15.

Constraints
    • The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted
    loop, not three separate prompts.
    • Create a flowchart before writing the program.

Challenges
    • Modify the program to prompt for how many numbers
    to add, instead of hard-coding the value. Be sure you
    convert the input to a number before doing the compar-
    ison.
    
    • Modify the program so that it only adds numbers and
    silently rejects non-numeric values. Count these invalid
    entries as attempts anyway. In other words, if the
    number of numbers to add is 5, your program should
    still prompt only five times.
