Exercise 23: Troubleshooting Car Issues

    An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program
    that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a
    task that a human expert might do. Many websites are
    available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by
    answering a series of questions. And many hardware and
    software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to
    help people solve simple technical issues before calling a
    human.
    
    Create a program that walks the user through troubleshoot-
    ing issues with a car. Use the following decision tree to build
    the system:
    
    Example Output
        Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
        Are the battery terminals corroded? n
        The battery cables may be damaged.
        Replace cables and try again.
    
    Constraint
        • Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and
        to the previous answers. Don’t ask for all inputs at once.
    
    Challenge
        • Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These
        are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are
        based on rules and facts. Identify a rules engine for your
        programming language and use it to solve this problem.
