Exercise26: Months to Pay Off a Credit Card

    It can take a lot longer to pay off your credit card balance
    than you might realize. And the formula for figuring that
    out isn’t pretty. Hiding the formula’s complexity with a
    function can help you keep your code organized.
    
    Write a program that will help you determine how many
    months it will take to pay off a credit card balance. The
    program should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit
    card and the APR of the card. The program should then
    return the number of months needed.
    
    The formula for this is
        n = (−1/30) * ((log(1 + b/p(1 - (1 + i)^30))) / log(1 + i))
    
    where
        • n is the number of months.
        • i is the daily rate (APR divided by 365).
        • b is the balance.
        • p is the monthly payment.
    
    Example Output
        What is your balance? 5000
        What is the APR on the card (as a percent)? 12
        What is the monthly payment you can make? 100
        It will take you 70 months to pay off this card.
    
    Constraints
        • Prompt for the card’s APR. Do the division internally.
        • Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
        • Use a function called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which
        accepts the balance, the APR, and the monthly payment
        as its arguments and returns the number of months.
        Don’t access any of these values outside the function.
        • Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent.
    
    Challenge
        • Rework the formula so the program can accept the
        number of months as an input and compute the
        monthly payment. Create a version of the program that
        lets the user choose whether to figure out the number
        of months until payoff or the amount needed to pay per
        month.
