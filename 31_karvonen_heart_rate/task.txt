Exercise 31: Karvonen Heart Rate

    When you loop, you can control how much you increment
    the counter; you don’t always have to increment by one.
    When getting into a fitness program, you may want to figure
    out your target heart rate so you don’t overexert yourself.
    The Karvonen heart rate formula is one method you can use
    to determine your rate. Create a program that prompts for
    your age and your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen for-
    mula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of
    intensities from 55% to 95%. Generate a table with the results
    as shown in the example output. The formula is
        TargetHeartRate = (((220 − age) − restingHR) × intensity) + restingHR
    
    Example Output
        Resting Pulse: 65   Age: 22
    
    Intensity | Rate
    ----------|--------
    55%       | 138 bpm
    60%       | 145 bpm
    65%       | 151 bpm
    :
    :
    85%       | 178 bpm
    90%       | 185 bpm
    95%       | 191 bpm
    
    Constraints
        • Don’t hard-code the percentages. Use a loop to incre-
        ment the percentages from 55 to 95.
        • Ensure that the heart rate and age are entered as num-
        bers. Don’t allow the user to continue without entering
        valid inputs.
        • Display the results in a tabular format.
    
    Challenge
        • Implement this as a GUI program that allows the user
        to use a slider control for the intensity, and update the
        interface in real time as the slider moves.
