Exercise 34 Employee List Removal

    Sometimes you have to locate and remove an entry from a
    list based on some criteria. You may have a deck of cards
    and need to discard one so it’s no longer in play, or you may
    need to remove values from a list of valid inputs once they’ve
    been used. Storing the values in an array makes this process
    easier. Depending on your language, you may find it safer
    and more efficient to create a new array instead of modifying
    the existing one.
    
    Create a small program that contains a list of employee
    names. Print out the list of names when the program runs
    the first time. Prompt for an employee name and remove
    that specific name from the list of names. Display the
    remaining employees, each on its own line.

Example Output
    There are 5 employees:
    John Smith
    Jackie Jackson
    Chris Jones
    Amanda Cullen
    Jeremy Goodwin

    Enter an employee name to remove: Chris Jones

    There are 4 employees:
    John Smith
    Jackie Jackson
    Amanda Cullen
    Jeremy Goodwin

Constraint
    • Use an array or list to store the names.

Challenges
    • If the user enters a name that’s not found, print out an
    error message stating that the name does not exist.
    • Read in the list of employees from a file, with each
    employee on its own line.
    • Write the output to the same file you read in.
