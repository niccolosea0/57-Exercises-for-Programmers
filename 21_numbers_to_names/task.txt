Exercise 21: Numbers to Names

    Many programs display information to the end user in one
    form but use a different form inside the program. For
    example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but
    behind the scenes you’ll have a numerical value for that
    color or an internal value because you may need to represent
    the textual description in another language for Spanish-
    speaking visitors.
    
    Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the
    corresponding month. Prompt for a number and display the
    corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and
    12 being December. For any value outside that range, display
    an appropriate error message.
    
    Example Output
        Please enter the number of the month: 3
        The name of the month is March.
    
    Constraints
        • Use a switch or case statement for this program.
        • Use a single output statement for this program.
    
    Challenges
        • Use a map or dictionary to remove the switch statement
        from the program.
        • Support multiple languages. Prompt for the language
        at the beginning of the program.
