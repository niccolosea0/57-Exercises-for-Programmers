Exercise 24: Anagram Checker

    Using functions to abstract the logic away from the rest of
    your code makes it easier to read and easier to maintain.
    Create a program that compares two strings and determines
    if the two strings are anagrams. The program should prompt
    for both input strings and display the output as shown in
    the example that follows.
    
    Example Output
        Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they
        are anagrams:
        Enter the first string: note
        Enter the second string: tone
        "note" and "tone" are anagrams.
    
    Constraints
        • Implement the program using a function called isAna-
        gram, which takes in two words as its arguments and
        returns true or false. Invoke this function from your main
        program.
        • Check that both words are the same length.
    
    Challenge
        • Complete this program without using built-in language
        features. Use selection or repetition logic instead and
        develop your own algorithm.
